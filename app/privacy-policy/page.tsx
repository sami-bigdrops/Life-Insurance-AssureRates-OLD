                In some cases, insurance agents, insurers, and Insurance
                Services may need to obtain additional background information
                about you. For example, consumer reports (including credit
                reports) may be ordered in connection with your insurance
                application. These reports provide information that may assist
                in determining your eligibility for insurance and the price you
                may be charged. Consumer reports may also be used for updates,
                renewals, or extensions of insurance. Insurance companies may
                also obtain and use a credit-based insurance score based on
                information contained in your consumer report. Insurance agents,
                insurers, and Insurance Services may use a third-party service
                provider in connection with the development of your insurance
                score and rate quote. By providing information to us for use in
                obtaining an insurance quote, you give your express consent for
                insurance agents, Insurers, Insurance Services, and associated
                third-party service providers with whom we share your Personal
                Information to obtain and use a consumer report as described in
                this paragraph.

                    a website, including our websites, an opt-out cookie is

                We employ software technology that enables us to track certain
                aspects of a user&apos;s visit to the Site. This technology
                helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what
                content is effective, how consumers engage with the Site, and
                how consumers arrive at and/or depart from the Site. The
                software typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1)
                &quot;tracking pixels&quot; and (2) &quot;clear gifs.&quot;
                Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code that are embedded
                in a web page that track usage activity including which pages
                are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are
                viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers
                which are embedded in web pages and email messages that track
                whether or not a user has viewed a particular web page or email
                message. User activity information may be associated with
                additional information about a user&apos;s session, such as IP
                addresses and the type of browser used, and Personal
                Information, if provided by the user.
